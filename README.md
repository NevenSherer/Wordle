#Wordle

This project is my app for AP Computer Science Principles for the 2025 AP Test
All code was written by me except for the lists of possible answers and guesses. The answers are from [cfreshman](https://github.com/cfreshman)'s project [wordle-nyt-answers-alphabetical.txt](https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/a7b776506c73284511034e63af1017ee). The possible guesses are from [tabatkin](https://github.com/tabatkins)'s [wordle-list](https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list).
